# Regression-Red-Wine-Quality-Dataset
STA 502 Applied Regression Final Project
The purpose of this project is to develop a regression model to predict the quality of red wine. This project is spilt into two main parts. The first part consisted of handling and processing the input data. The data was combined, scaled, and examined for which predictors to include in the final model. The second part of the project was training the actual model. A number of different regression models were tested and evaluated, including multiple linear regression, best subset regression, ridge regression, lasso regression, and logistic regression.
The dataset was retrieved from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality
